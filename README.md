# Weather_App

This is a Python weather app I am making for a project!


Day 1: Planning and Setup:

Plan out your project and what features you want to include in your weather app; Show the current weather

Set up your development environment and create a new Python project

Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap and familiarize yourself with the API documentation; OpenWeatherMap.org

Day 2: Retrieve Weather Data:

Write code to retrieve weather data for a specific location using the OpenWeatherMap API

Parse the JSON data and extract the relevant information, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed

Display the weather data in the console to verify that it's working correctly

Day 3: User Interface Design:

Choose a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQT to create the user interface for your weather app

Plan and design the layout of your app, including any buttons, text boxes, or other UI elements you want to include

Day 4: User Interface Implementation:

Implement the user interface for your weather app using the GUI library you chose in Day 3

Integrate your weather data retrieval code into the UI so that it displays the weather data in the app

Test the UI to make sure it's working correctly

Day 5: Error Handling and User Input:

Add error handling to your weather data retrieval code to handle cases where the API returns an error or the user enters an invalid location

Allow the user to enter their location as a text input, and use geocoding services like the Google Maps API to convert the location to latitude and longitude coordinates for use with the OpenWeatherMap API

Day 6: Testing, Refactoring, and Additional Features:

Test your app to make sure it's working correctly and handling all possible cases

Refactor your code to make it more modular and maintainable

Consider adding additional features or functionality to your app, such as multiple location support, hourly forecasts, or a more polished UI
